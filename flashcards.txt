coercion : implicitly changing the type of a value in order to complete an operation correctly
binding : a relationship between a name and something else in a program
method : a function which performs an action on an object
overloading : assigning multiple meanings to the same name in a program
parameter : a variable carrying input in to a function or method
argument : a value passed in to a parameter
interpreted : a language that is executed line-by-line by another program
compiled : a language that is converted from source code in to machine code before it is executed
runtime error : an error in a program due to it performing an illegal operation during its execution
syntax error : an error in a program due to it not conforming to the grammar of the language
operator : a symbol or keyword used to identify an operation to be performed on one or more expressions
literal : a value written in to the code of a program 
is : the python operator that determines if the identity of two objects is the same
== : the python operator that deterimens if the value of two objects is the same
statement : A single instruction in an imperative program
side affect : a change in state of a program outside of the current scope, or a change to the environment outside of a program (due to the program)
block : a sequence of statements and other blocks in a program
referencing environment : collection of variable bindings available within a certain scope of a program
mutable : can be changed 
immutable : cannot be changed
casting : explicitly converting a value of one type to another
strong types : a type system in which operations can only be attempted on data that conforms to the type constraints necessary for the operation
static types : a type system in which the type of values which can be stored in a variable are specified at the time the program is compiled and cannot be changed at run time
dynamic types : a type system in which the type of values stored in variables may change during run time
duck : a typing scheme which determines types are compatible as long as the requested methods or properties are present within the object
short circuit : the type of evaluation of boolean expressions which ends as soon as the final value of the expression can be determined
syntactic sugar : a language construct that is unnecessary but perhaps makes code shorter or easier to read
slicing : the process of taking a subsequence of a sequence by specifying a range with the beginning and ending values separated by a colon
list : a datastructure which contains a sequence of objects and is mutable
tuple : a datastructure which contains a sequence of objects and is immutable
set : a datastructure which does not support order or multiplicity of elements and is mutable
frozen set : a datastructure which does not support order or multiplicity of elements and is immutable
dictionary : a datastructure which relates arbitrary, hashable, and immutable keys to arbitrary values
concatenation : an operation which joins two sequences together in a new sequence
del : the keyword in java used to remove a variable binding (or a key-value relationship from a collection)
